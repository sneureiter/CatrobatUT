# First Steps #

There are currently two ways to import the project:
  * [**old way** without gradle in eclipse](#eclipse)
  * [**new way** with gradle](#gradle)
  
It is recommended to use the [**gradle way**](#gradle) to import the project since the old version won't be supported any longer from us.

## Eclipse ##
1. Get the repo via shell: `git clone git@github.com:Catrobat/Catroid.git`
2. Drink some coffee - the repo size is about 100 MBs (2013-12-17)
3. Open Eclipse and select a workspace of your choice
4. Import every project from the cloned repo (File > Import... > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Next > Select root directory (browse to it, confirm and wait until Eclipse shows you all projects below) > Finish
5. Wait until Eclipse reads/compiles everything
6. Maybe some cleanups will help to clear any compile errors - if any (Project > Clean... > Clean all projects > OK)
7. Also take care that a Project Build Target is chosen (Project > Properties > Android > choose any Build Target of your choice > OK)

### Warning ###
 
egit (Eclipse extension for git) will ignore some git settings and will make trouble with line endings!

## Gradle ##
You should have following path variables defined:
  * ```JAVA_HOME```
  * ```ANDROID_HOME```
  * and your git location in ```PATH```

After above settings are done it should be pretty easy:

1. Get the repo via shell: `git clone git@github.com:Catrobat/Catroid.git`
2. Drink some coffee - the repo size is about 100 MBs (2013-12-17)
3. (optional:) Open your command line tool in the cloned folder and execute ```gradlew tasks``` (```gradlew.bat tasks``` for windows user)
4. Import the ```Catroid``` folder into your IDE

**It's recommended to use the gradle-wrapper (```gradlew```) from within the project!**
